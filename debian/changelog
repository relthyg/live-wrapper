live-wrapper (0.7) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Add contrib and non-free components to apt config. Needed to allow for
    building for images including firmware.
  * Add command-line config for the apt-mirror (the mirror to be
    configured inside the image), and change the default to use
    deb.debian.org. Also switch the default build apt source to use
    deb.debian.org
  * Add command-line config for addition of firmware packages, and update
    the docs about Customising Packages
  * In the standard customise script, generate lists of the packages
    installed in the image, and their sources.
  * Change to how apt-ftparchive is called, so the installer will
    work. This was part of the cause of #865015
  * Tweak the size of the isolinux menu so long menus will display
    better. This was the cause of #861421
  * Add support for specifying the Volume ID of the output image.
    Closes: #865384
  * Set the mode of the ISO root dir to 0755 (rwxr-xr-x).
    Closes: #865386
  * Tweaks to the code for handling extra debs and udebs
    + Separate downloading and creating metadata files
    + Match the pool dir layout from the Debian archive more closely
    + Add support for "base" debs
    + Generate Packages and Release files separately for debs and udebs
  * Add extra metadata to make d-i happy to install without network
    This was part of the cause of #865015

   - Logging has seen some improvements
   - Subdirectories within the CD root are now handled by a helper class
  * Installer:
   - Live image builds will now have installers by default

     will appear in a future version)
   - Packages and Release files are generated for the CD-ROM pool

     for #843983)
   - systemd-networkd is no longer used in the live system
  * Bootloaders:
   - Bootloader files are only installed in the CD root when requested
   - Bootloader configurations are now shared between ISOLINUX and GRUB

  [ Ana C. Custura ]
  * Utilities:

   - Hardware Detection Tool can now be installed into the image through a
     command line flag (not yet installed in the bootloader menu though)
  * Bootloaders:
   - Menu entries for booting memtest86+ and HDT exist in the abstract
     configuration (though are not yet serialised to the configurations
     written)
   - The installer can now be launched from either bootloader, either text-mode
     or graphical

  Thanks to the sponsors of the vmdebootstrap sprint, where the majority of
  these changes were made.
