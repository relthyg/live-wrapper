Quickstart
==========

Super Fast Quickstart
---------------------

Building images with live-wrapper is quite simple. For the impatient:

.. code-block:: shell

 sudo apt install live-wrapper
 sudo lwr

This will build you a file named ``output.iso`` in the current directory
containing a minimal live-image.

.. warning::

 Currently live-wrapper will create a lot of files and directories in the
 current working directory. There is a TODO item to move these to a temporary
 location and clean up afterwards, though this has not yet been fully
 implemented. You may want to use an empty directory to run ``lwr`` in.

Customising the Image
---------------------

There are a number of supported command-line arguments that can be passed to
live-wrapper. These change the behaviour to create a customised image.

Changing the Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the ISO image will be built using the ``stretch`` distribution. If
you'd like to build using ``buster`` or ``sid`` you can pass the ``-d``
parameter to live-wrapper like so:

.. code-block:: shell

 sudo lwr -d buster

.. note::

 You must use the codename, and not the suite (e.g. stable), when specifying
 the distribution.

Using an Alternative Mirror
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, ``vmdebootstrap`` will use the mirror configured in your
``/etc/apt/sources.list``. If you have a faster mirror available, you may want
to change the mirror you're using to create the image. You can do this with the
``-m`` parameter:

.. code-block:: shell

 sudo lwr -m http://localhost/debian/

You may also configure the mirror that will be configured *inside* the
image. This will be used for any extra packages that are specified,
and will also be the mirror that the image will use after the build is
complete. Change this with the ``--apt-mirror`` parameter:

.. code-block:: shell

 sudo lwr -m http://localhost/debian/ --apt-mirror http://deb.debian.org/debian

By default this is set to ``http://deb.debian.org/debian``

Customising Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several methods for specifying extra packages to be
installed into the live image:

 * ``-t`` / ``--tasks`` should be used to give a list of **task**
   packages to be included in the image. These will be installed as
   part of the ``vmdebootstrap`` hook, so all their "Depends" and
   "Recommends" will be installed too.

 * ``-e`` / ``--extra`` allows for a list of extra non-task packages
   to be installed, again with all their "Depends" and "Recommends"
   included.

 * ``-f`` / ``--firmware`` allows for a list of firmware packages to
   be installed in the image, again with all their "Depends" and
   "Recommends" included. **Also** each of these packages will be
   downloaded and saved into the image so that an included installer
   will automatically find them for installation. **BEWARE** that
   using this option is likely to mean your image will include
   non-free software. Check the licensing carefully before
   distributing it.

For example:

.. code-block:: shell

 sudo lwr -e vim -t science-typesetting

.. code-block:: shell

 sudo lwr -e "emacs25 jed" -t live-task-xfce -f "firmware-iwlwifi firmware-realtek"

Setting the Volume ID
---------------------

The Volume ID is the embedded label in the ISO image; this is what
will be displayed on the desktop when a DVD or USB flash drive
containing the image is inserted into a computer. The default is
``DEBIAN LIVE``, or you can change this using the ``--volume_id``
parameter. There is a 32-character limit for what can be specified
here. Example:

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo lwr --volume_id "My live image"

Testing the Image with QEMU
---------------------------

You can easily test your created live images with QEMU.

.. warning:: You will need to increase the amount of memory available to
             QEMU when running the live image. The image will crash if run
             with the default memory limit.

To test the image using BIOS boot:

.. code-block:: shell

 qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2G -cdrom live.iso

For EFI boot you will need to install the ``ovmf`` package and then run:


.. code-block:: shell

 qemu-system-x86_64 -bios /usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd -m 2G -cdrom live.iso 

To test with an emulated USB device, run:

.. code-block:: shell

 qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2G -usbdevice disk:live.iso

To test the speech synthesis installer option, you will need to add the
following to the QEMU invocation:

.. code-block:: shell

 -soundhw sb16,es1370,adlib

.. note::

 Using -hda to attach the disk image will prevent the installer from detecting
 the "CD-ROM" as this is not a removable device, it is an emulated attached hard
 disk drive.
